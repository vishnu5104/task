# Deploying and Interacting with ERC20 and Vault Contracts in Hardhat

This leverages Solidity and Hardhat to demonstrate the deployment and interaction between an ERC20 token and a Vault contract. The ERC20 token represents a customizable digital currency, while the Vault contract provides a secure mechanism for depositing and withdrawing these tokens. Aimed at developers and enthusiasts in the blockchain space, this project serves as a practical guide to smart contract development, testing, and interaction within the Ethereum ecosystem.
